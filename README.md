# Josh Crain
This site uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io) for static site generation. Changes are tracked with Git and pushed [here](https://github.com/joshcrain/eleventy-intro) using command line. The site is deployed automatically by Netlify using [continuous deployment](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#deploy-with-git).

I used <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/build-a-blog/" rel="noopener">an article</a> from Filament Group to get me started.
