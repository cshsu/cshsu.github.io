<p class="lead">A little more about Josh Crain; his work, history, and personal records.</p>

Josh Crain is an Iowa native, designer, developer, and student of art. He studied art and design at the University of Northern Iowa and received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. He has worked as a web designer, product designer, and UI developer. He doesn’t love talking about himself in the third person, so he's going to stop that now if you don’t mind.

I want to get better at what I do. I created this site to practice and learn&mdash;practice the fundimentals of web design and learn more web development. I also wanted to share my work. There isn't much now, but over time I plan to add more design, illustration, and art. 

## Family History

I am a 12th generation descendant of colonial settlers. I created a website of <a href="/ancestry/">Crain family ancestry</a> as a way to explore my interest in heritage and progeny, and as place to catalog my findings. I learned some interesting things about <em>heraldry</em>&mdash;something I knew nothing about. You are most welcome to <a href="/say-hello/">contact me</a> with any interest.

## Keytarist
Many summers ago I played the <a href="/notes/2020/yamaha-shs-10/">keytar</a> in <em>Dr. Mike</em>, one the the greatest bands of all time. You should buy our album, <em>A Mighty Love</em>, on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Love-Dr-Mike/dp/B000FSMMNK/" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-mighty-love/97175026" rel="noopener">iTunes</a>. You'll thank me.
