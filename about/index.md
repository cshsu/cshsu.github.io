<p class="lead">Josh Crain is a designer, developer, and student of art.</p>

I have worked as a web designer, product designer, and front-end developer. I want to improve at what I do. I created this site to practice and learn&mdash;practice the fundamentals of web design and learn more web development. I also wanted to share my work. Over time I plan to add more design, illustration, and art to this site. 

## Family History
<figure style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;width:auto;max-width:100px;width:25%;"> <img src="https://joshcrain.github.io/ancestry/images/crane-coat-of-arms.png" alt="Crane of Suffolk, England Coat Of Arms. Argent, a fesse between three crosses crosslet fitchÃ©e Guls, crest a crane ppr.">

I created a website of <a href="/ancestry/">Crain family ancestry</a> as a way to explore my interest in heritage and progeny, and as place to catalog my findings. I learned some interesting things about <em>heraldry</em>&mdash;something I knew nothing about. You are most welcome to <a href="/say-hello/">contact me</a> with any interest.

## Keytarist
Many summers ago I played the <a href="/notes/2020/yamaha-shs-10/">keytar</a> in <em>Dr. Mike</em>, one the the greatest bands of all time. You should buy our album, <em>A Mighty Love</em>, on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Love-Dr-Mike/dp/B000FSMMNK/" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> or <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-mighty-love/97175026" rel="noopener">iTunes</a>. You'll thank me.
