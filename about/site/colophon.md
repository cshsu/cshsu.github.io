 This site was created with VSCode on a Mac with HTML, Markdown, Liquid, Nunjucks, CSS, and Javascript. This site uses standards compliant mark-up and a custom responsive layout with the goal of simplicity and speed. I use <a href="https://11ty.io/" rel="noopener">Eleventy</a> for static page generation and <a href="https://www.netlify.com" rel="noopener">Netlify</a> for hosting. 

 The serif typeface is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond" rel="noopener">EB Garamond</a>. Foreground and background colors have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio at Level AA or better as specified by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" rel="noopener">WCAG 2.0</a>.
