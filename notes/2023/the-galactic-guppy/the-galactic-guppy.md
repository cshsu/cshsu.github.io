## A long time ago in a place far, far away...
A recent college graduate entered a new world of responsibility, broke and underprepared. Jobless and with few prospects, he drew cartoons for a few dollars. He had the vague idea this would somehow help him avoid financial ruin. Even with only mediocre success he persisted, secure in the fact he had so very little to lose. [The Galactic Guppy](https://galacticguppy.net/), _The Ultimate Fish Out Of Water Story_, was born out of these efforts; though quickly abandoned when a more reliable source of income presented itself.

These are the untold stories.
