- I made some sweeping changes to this site. Images are processed with Eleventy Image instead of a variety of Cloudinary API, manual optimizations, etc. 
- Along the way I lost my Obsidian templates used for weeknotes and other page boilerplates. Adding those to git.  
- Images are saved along side markdown documents. I went back and forth over the best way to manage the images and supporting docs, right now I think this is best and more portable. 
- The art section is still pretty sparse.
