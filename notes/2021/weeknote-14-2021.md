description: RSS and a second trip to Hy-Vee.

- Downloaded [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/)... again. 
- Fixed the RSS feed on this site so it now includes HTML. I tested the feed and viewed it in a browser but had never seen it in an RSS reader. 
- Second trip to the 86th Hy-Vee. 
- This week my allergies have been particularly bad. Out of curiosity I checked the local pollen counts and it appears that _juniper_ pollen is high at the moment. This spring has been worse than usual.
