- Went for a run. 3 miles, 20:56 (6:58 min/mi). My first run since January. 
- Holding steady at #34 on the [Speedlify Leaderboard](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/#site-953e66da).
- Following Stephanie Eckles ([@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph)) is one of the better things I have done recently. [Smol](https://smolcss.dev/) contains some big knowledge in some little snippets.
