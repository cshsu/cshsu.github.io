- Last weekend I left the state for the first time since November of 2019. 
- Had a good 3 mile run on Wednesday. A new high, 61 mL/(kgÂ·min) VO<sub>2</sub> max, measured on my Garmin watch. Mile splits: 6:41, 6:26, 6:33. Average heart rate was 147 bpm. 
- Made more progress on a [HSLA color system](https://codepen.io/joshcrain/pen/zYoXjaN).
