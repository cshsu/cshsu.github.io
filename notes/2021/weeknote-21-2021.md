- I woke up early Sunday morning with vertigo and a cold or allergies. It's been an uncomfortable week. 
- Saturday I decided to go to the doctor. Double ear infection contributed to the vertigo. 
- Added to my Bitbucket Pipeline's automation to include publishing production-ready CSS to S3 and sending a corresponding notification to my project's Slack channel.
