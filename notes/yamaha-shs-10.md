<span class="dropcap">B</span>ack in 2006, I experimented a bit with photorealism in Adobe Illustrator. At the time I played the keytar in a band called Dr. Mike (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Love-Dr-Mike/dp/B000FSMMNK/">Amazon</a>,  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-mighty-love/97175026">iTunes</a>). It was the perfect object for rendering in this way. I still see this image in image searches for the Yamaha SHS-10, even though I published it on the web for at least 10 years.
