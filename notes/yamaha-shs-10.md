<span class="dropcap">B</span>ack in 2006, I was introduced to an [artist’s website](http://lifeinvector.com) by a co-worker. I followed her [gradient mesh tutorial](http://lifeinvector.com/downloads/) (I cannot believe this is still online) and learned a lot about Adobe Illustrator. At the time I played the keytar in a band called Dr. Mike (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Love-Dr-Mike/dp/B000FSMMNK/">Amazon</a>,  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-mighty-love/97175026">iTunes</a>). I still see this image in searches for the Yamaha SHS-10, even though it’s been at least ten years since I last published it online.
