Over the weekend I was pleased to receive an email from my college professor [Roy R. Behrens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Behrens). Roy taught the first graphic design class I took in college. It was so impactful I decided to change my emphasis. His later classes and encouragement further convinced me to pursue a career in design. After graduation, when I had become frustrated with the job market I reached out to him. Roy passed along a lead that ultimately became my first job.

In June he featured my student work in a video he produced, titled [Solving Problems in Design](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yqvUkuJuNaI). The video was presented at a symposium that followed an exhibition titled *Evolving Graphic Design*.

> In May 2022, an invitational exhibition titled Evolving Graphic Design was curated by graphic designer Yeohyun Ahn at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. This concluded in late June with a hybrid (both online and in-person) symposium, featuring short presentations by various exhibitors. This video on using problems in teaching design was presented by author and designer Roy R. Behrens.
