description: Remembering why I made this website in the first place.

This website began with one goal—to have a website again, a place to share my work. Then, as I often do, I found a tempting distraction. This time it was _site speed_. My focus turned to limiting requests, avoiding layout shifts, and reducing bytes—all worthy pursuits. I even found [a way to measure](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/#site-953e66da) my efforts and see how they stack up. What fun!

Tinkering is something I enjoy. I tinker in the garage, in the garden, with bikes, and on house projects. The list goes on. It’s a great way to learn. I pick up hobbies like I’m going to live to be 200 years old. But earlier this year I realized I had avoided my initial goal. You see, tinkering is a way for me to make, build, or improve without any real commitment. In this case, it was a way for me to replace _proactive_ vision with _reactive_ metrics.

Since March I focused more on a coherent design path. I’ve improved typography and refactored styles. I created an SVG self-portrait to dress up the homepage and started to make and share more artwork. I’m pleased with where I am and the renewed focus—even if it’s hard to see or measure.
