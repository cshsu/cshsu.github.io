- Last week I published [2022 in review](/notes/2022/2022-in-review/). 
- Happy New Year!
- Published a post about  [Web components and styling slotted content](/notes/2023/lobotomized-owl-web-component-slots/). Web components have forced me to re-learn some core (for me) concepts with CSS. For one, there is almost no "cascade."
- Celebrated being a year older.
