* Highs in the 70s this week. It is quite the change from last week which had October’s 3rd snowfall. 
* I spent some time assessing accessibility improvements. I used a tool called [SortSite](https://www.powermapper.com/products/sortsite/) to report _a11y_ issues on entire websites. The prioritization can begin. 
* Daylight savings :( 
* Tuesday was Election Day. Our ballots were returned to the county’s election office last week. The line to vote was around the block. We were able jump to the front with our absentee ballots where we handed it directly to an official. With all the talk of delays in mail service we opted to do it in person. 
* Wednesday after the election votes were still being counted to determine the presidency. Biden addressed supporters after midnight and urged patience. Trump declared himself the winner around 1:30 am Central. He claimed “fraud” and called the election an “embarrassment to the country.”
* Wednesday morning the U.S. Senate appears to remain in Republican control. Iowa election results did not indicate a blue wave, as many had predicted. 
* Thursday morning the presidency is still too close to call. Waiting on Pennsylvania, Georgia, and Arizona.
* I wil not be returning to an office work environment any time before March 1, 2021. 
* COVID-19 cases are on the rise. The U.S. has eclipsed 100,000 cases in a single day. On Thursday, 4,562 were reported in Iowa. Both were new records. 
* Pennsylvania is called for Biden on Saturday giving him the needed electoral votes needed to win.
