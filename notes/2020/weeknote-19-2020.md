* [Improved my VS Code workflow](https://css-tricks.com/some-little-improvements-to-my-vs-code-workflow-workspaces-icons-tasks/): Saved VS Code workspaces to my computer’s dock, made custom icons, added a `tasks.json` to [automatically run](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks#_run-behavior) the correct terminal commands when each workspace is opened. Additionally, I added a [Terminal alias](https://mattmazur.com/2012/01/27/how-to-add-terminal-aliases-in-mac-os-x-lion/) to quickly [mount an SMB share from command line](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/171822). 
* Received a call from DART Paratransit to tell me a passenger, who was on the same bus as my dad two and a half hours prior, has tested positive for COVID-19. 
* Just when I think 2020 can’t get any weirder… I received a company email with a [Cameo](https://www.cameo.com/) video. [Brian Baumgartner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Baumgartner) announced _the office_ will continue half-day Fridays this summer. He suggested we go to the beach and eat hot dogs with all our free time. 
* Ran Sunday night. Best 1K: 4:01, best mile: 6:29, 5K: 21:10. 
* This week I saw a modest improvement on the [Eleventy Accessibility Leaderboard](https://www.11ty.dev/leaderboard/a11y/)  with a 18th place (out of 310 sites). An _axe_ score of 357 and 100 for Lighthouse. The [performance ranking](https://www.11ty.dev/leaderboard/perf/) continues to lag behind with a 218th place (an improvement of 23 places) with a 99 Lighthouse score. 
* A pair of wrens began work on a nest in the backyard birdhouse.
