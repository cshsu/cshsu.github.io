We parked the car near a marked trail and traced a few narrow paths across Bodega Head in search of a view. The acrid smell of stale smoke filled the morning. In the distance the bay and horizon were one, grounded only by the sea stacks. Closer now to the the ocean the air moved more freely, the briny smells of beach below stifled by the static haze. We retraced our steps and continued south until we reached a marker for Shell Beach. Crooked wooden steps descended down the bluff.
