## Saturday, March 21st
* We decided to get out of the house today. It was the first day for me in three or four days. We took a walk in Walnut Woods. I pulled the wagon with the small ones through the grass along a tree line. Everyone kept a careful and watchful distance.  The park was busier than I’ve seen before,
* N. announced she thought we needed a garden this year. 
* Stood in the driveway for a few minutes to take in the view of Venus high in the western sky—which is particularly bright tonight.

## Friday, March 20th
* Working from home has proven to be a challenge with 2 young ones. 
* Finished the workweek with a virtual social hour. 

## Thursday, March 19th
From Lynn Ungar, a poem called [Pandemic](http://www.lynnungar.com/poems/pandemic/). "What if you thought of it / as the Jews consider the Sabbath– / the most sacred of times?" 

## Wednesday, March 18th
* Ants in the dishwasher, which prompted me explore the crawl space. The added thing I didn’t need. 
* Dow closes below 20,000
* Drake Relays postponed 

## Tuesday, March 17th
A fine fresh day, no clouds, and a harsh midday sun. Walked to the corner of 66th and Sunset pulling a wagon with two quiet children. N. trailed behind with the dog while she listened to a conference call. Neighbors worked quietly on projects in their yards. 

## Monday, March 16th
* Des Moines Mayor issues a state of emergency. 
* White House urges people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, avoid bars and restaurants.

### The Greatest Generation
I have such admiration for my grandparent’s generation. They were children of The Great Depression and heroic in a world war both at home and abroad. At home, communities organized drives and individuals planted victory gardens to bring liberation from tyranny. Though not always in direct danger themselves, they were united in sacrifice for those who were. They are known as The Greatest Generation—and for good reason. 

In the last week, we have seen runs on supplies at grocery stores. Closings pour in, yet many continue to be [dismissive of the threat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifKbwDf51bA). Social distancing (even for the sake of the most vulnerable) is seen as fear. At the same time, others (especially on social media) seem to find pleasure in the misfortune and bumblings of the current administration. 

It saddens me how we forget. 

## Sunday, March 15th
* Beginning to plan for an extended period of remote work, in-home child care, and social distancing. 
* Amazon, Sam’s, and Ace Hardware are sold out of toilet paper. Hy-Vee had some available, a limit of two.
* My dad’s assisted living community announced they will block all visitors until further notice. 
* The CDC is not recommending gatherings of 50 or more.  
* The Fed has cut interest rates to 0. 
* The Iowa Legislative Session has been delayed for at least 30 days. 
* Governor Reynolds suggests schools close for four weeks.
