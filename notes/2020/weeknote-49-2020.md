* This week is much cooler than last. The leaves are all raked and Christmas lights hang on the bushes, all before we lost another ten degrees. Considering all the unplanned events of the the last several months this feels especially well played. 
* [HeydonWorks](https://heydonworks.com/) got me thinking about progressive enhancement, through a hilarious _backwards_ approach: “Please disable JavaScript to view this site.”
* I made changes to this site: 
	* The navigation to manually toggle dark mode only appears when javascript is enabled. 
	* Do not include a date in the tag list if there is not one specified. 
	* I didn’t think _about_ pages needed dates. 
* Finished reading _Farewell My Lovely_, by Raymond Chandler. 
* Started reading _The Splendid and the Vile_, by Erik Larson for a change of pace. I have always admired the resolve of families, both here and abroad, who rallied around the work and sacrifice needed on each respective home front. 
* Spent my lunches hanging new lights on the house. Looking into a new modem and router to better reach and manage the smart bulbs. 
* D., S., and B. all tested positive for Covid-19. B., 94, is home with oxygen. 
* I developed a scratchy throat on Friday.
