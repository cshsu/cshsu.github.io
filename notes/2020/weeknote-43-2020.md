* This site dropped 6 places to 8th on the [Eleventy Leaderboards](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/). 
* It has snowed twice this last week. 66 degrees on Thursday. 
* Thinking about [The Widening Responsibility For Front End Developers ](https://css-tricks.com/the-widening-responsibility-for-front-end-developers/) and the discomfort that goes along with it. 
* Two runs this week. [20:50](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/5709086354) and [21:14](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/5713679912) for 3 miles. 
* Finished _[Anna Karenina](https://a.co/i0Xrb6W)_.
* Started _[Empire of the Summer Moon](https://a.co/hlh9MMX)_. 
* Sent an absentee ballot request form.
