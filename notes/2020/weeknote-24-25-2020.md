* Exhausted by the end of these two weeks. 
* Awoke at 3:30 am on Wednesday and was unable to go back to sleep. Went for a 5K prior to a 5:30 am work start time. 
* [Proud of my wife](https://twitter.com/thenicolecrain/status/1271107807304200192). 
* Cleaning and donating what we know wonâ€™t be needed in the short-term. Next week we may learn how our life changes. This week we make preparations.
