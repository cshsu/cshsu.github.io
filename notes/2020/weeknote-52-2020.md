* Witnessed the [Great Conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction) or “Christmas Star” on the 21st as Jupiter came visually closer to Saturn. The two did not merge into one star has I had expected. Jupiter appeared larger and brighter, lower and to the left of Saturn. I was surprised to be able to see it from the house, through the tops of the trees. 
* Nearly all the snow melted by the morning of the 23rd then the temperature dropped 45 degrees. Snow again on Christmas Eve and bitter cold. 
* [Posted](https://twitter.com/thejoshcrain/status/1341845259429539840) a web comic: “Slow and steady... It’ll all be over by... Christmas.” after much internal debate. 
* A very nice Christmas at home. Phone calls and Facetime to family.
