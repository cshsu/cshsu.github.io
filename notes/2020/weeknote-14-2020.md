* Saturday’s run was a little faster than normal. 6:43, 6:43, 6:47 for 3 miles. I was in the woods north of Hickman when the warning sirens began to wail for their routine test.  A bit eerie. 
* Weather has been a mix of perfect spring days and freezing rain.
* In addition to heart cut-outs, our neighbors have also placed stuffed bears in the windows. Families are “going on a bear hunt” while on walks through the neighborhood. 
* I started work around 5am each day this week in an effort to get 8 hours of work. 
* Several years ago I saved seeds from a yellow Brandywine Tomato. I retrieved the bag from an old cigar box in the basement. I filled an egg carton with a scoop of dirt from the garden and planted a seed in each space. Today they are warming in the window. In a few weeks I should know if the seeds are viable. 
* I made a few changes to this site. Sunday I saw an improvement to my rank on the [Top 200 Eleventy Sites](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/sites/). _Performance Rank_ #156 _Lighthouse_ **99**
