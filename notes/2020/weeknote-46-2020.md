* Our small tree was loaded with leaves Sunday morning, by afternoon there were less than 40 leaves left. Temperatures are dipping into the 20s by the end of the week. 
* Sunday: [For the first time](https://twitter.com/okayhenderson/status/1325588092309397504) the number of Covid-19 patients in Iowa hospitals is over 1000. 
* City buildings are being closed again and schools are moving to online instruction. 
* Finished [Empire of the Summer Moon](https://read.amazon.com/kp/kshare?asin=B003KN3MDG&id=6n4q54jsg5ah5jk5tojniheara&ref_=r_sa_glf_b_0_hdrw_ss_AAAUAAA&reshareId=DKBFJSCTQREG37WVPC2T&reshareChannel=system). 
* Implemented a version of a [CSS only “click to animate gif” solution](https://christianheilmann.com/2020/07/16/a-css-only-click-to-animate-gif-solution/). A really smart solution that sets the opacity of the GIF to 0 until a hidden checkbox has been checked. Unfortunately, the tool I use to measure accessibility still flags the animated GIF. At a minimum, it’s a smart way to address the a11y issues until the GIFs can be updated or eliminated all together.
