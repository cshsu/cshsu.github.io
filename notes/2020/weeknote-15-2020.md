* I am such a fan of Tad Retz. I keep thinking of this video of [painting in the Trapp Forest](https://youtu.be/wRYNCPFgdwA). His sketches remind me of *John F. Carlson*. 
* I found an article about [inclusive inputs](https://www.ovl.design/text/inclusive-inputs/) helpful enough to incorporate aspects into a design system. 
* I ran in the evening for first time in maybe a year. Venus was bright in the west and the bats were active overhead. I didn’t notice the moon rising in the east until I turned for home. I passed a couple about my age along the trail who had stopped to enjoy the view of the Supermoon through the trees. 
* Tuesday, more than 100 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Iowa. This was the first day the count was greater than 100. 
* Spent a little time trying to get so Eleventy plugins to work. Not much luck. 
* A neighbor sewed masks for us from using a pattern provided by Mercy Hospital. 
* Aside from the occasional check-in on Twitter I’ve almost completely avoided the 24-hour news cycle. 
* The US surgeon general said this week is going to be the "hardest and the saddest" for "most Americans' lives," describing the upcoming period as a "Pearl Harbor moment" and a "9/11 moment."
