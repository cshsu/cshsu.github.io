* Took a close look at [Perch Pattern Library](http://patterns.perchcms.com/) and [Bits for 24 Ways](http://bits.24ways.org/) to see how others have used Fractal to create a Pattern Library. 
* Added this site to Google Search Console
* [I was reminded](https://twitter.com/kyletwebster/status/1079951516738482176) the method I’ve seen for drawing heads and faces is called the Reilly Method.
* I used SVGO on this site and saved 320 bytes per page.
* It’s really interesting to see what [HTML attributes can do for two factor authentication](https://www.twilio.com/blog/html-attributes-two-factor-authentication-autocomplete).  This is something I’ve seen in the wild, but didn’t know how it worked. 
* The effects of COVID-19 are here. The NCAA cancels all winter and spring championships—_including March Madness_. This is amazing for a number of reasons, but consider this: the outdoor track & field season hasn’t even started yet.
