* It might have been the long day at home after 2 months of quarantine, but the level of teamwork and efficiency of the drive through staff at Chic-fil-A was downright inspiring. 
* Tuesday vet appointment. For now the mysterious skin lesions that began in November 2018 are under control. The only thing that seems to help is prednisone. Nothing new diagnosed.
* Customers are not allowed in the vet building, they must call from the parking lot and wait for a worker to come out. A sign with instructions and a phone number is clearly posted outside the building. Their other location is completely closed down because they had a COVID-19 case in the building, though they had taken precautions. 
* Monday began at 4 am, an early start with the children. Work began at 4:30 am. 
* The dog has not been well, started dry heaving on Monday. A few days earlier discolored urine, a urine sample was delivered to the vet, no UTI.
* While researching Microsoft’s end of support for IE11 (2025), I learned Microsoft Edge is available for Mac OS. I’m not sure what fact is more astonishing.
