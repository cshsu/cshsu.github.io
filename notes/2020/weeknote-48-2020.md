metaDescription: Chrome bug, modified Thanksgiving, more Raymond Chandler.

*  I found a bug in Chrome 87.0.4280.67. It is not present in Canary 89.0.4334.0.  An unwanted grey border or box appears on or near a `<fieldset>`  element when there is a combination of border-radius, background, and a border color with an alpha transparency. [The issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1150372&q=fieldset&can=2) was reported to the Chromium team a few days before. 
* This week I finished reading _The Big Sleep_ by Raymond Chandler and started _Farewell My Lovely_. I’ve noticed several references to Iowa in these two reads, he seems to have spent some time in the state. 
* The illustration work of [Sheilah Beckett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheilah_Beckett) is really nice. 
* Thanksgiving was spent at home. Small, mostly quiet. In the next few days we learned some family has been sick, with what, we aren’t sure.
