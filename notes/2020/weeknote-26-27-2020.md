* 4th of July
* Back at the office for the second time since March 17th.
* As a result of two miscommunications I received three new computer monitors from Amazon.
* Received a new 13‚Äù MacBook Pro to replace a late 2012 iMac.
* Added three [popular Netlify build plugins](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/06/22/top-10-netlify-build-plugins/) to this site to allow me to customize the build process and automate build tasks.
* Image Optim - Optimize PNG, JPEG, GIF and SVG file formats. [Git Repo](https://github.com/chrisdwheatley/netlify-plugin-image-optim). 
* Minify HTML - Add HTML minification as a post-processing optimization. [Git Repo](https://github.com/philhawksworth/netlify-plugin-minify-html).
* Lighthouse - Automatically run a Lighthouse audit on your site after every build. [Git Repo](https://github.com/netlify-labs/netlify-plugin-lighthouse). 
* Finding some use for [CSS smooth scroll](https://css-tricks.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=155f5a9ccc4e24c318130cace&id=32fd049631&e=396e02eedc).
