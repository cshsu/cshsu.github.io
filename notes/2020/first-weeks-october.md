## I. 
buoyed mounds of mist <br>
drift under the silent dome <br>
slowly asunder   

## II. 
night answers her kin<br>
with a stillness bathed in blue<br>
abiding till dawn 

## III. 
gilded bough and blade<br>
point west to the autumn blaze<br>
higher now the rays

## IV. 
a flit and flicker <br>
hops through willow and wicker <br>
weaving threads of light

## V. 
the maple crimsons <br>
then sheds her resplendent robe <br>
for a winter rest  

## VI. 
shadows move beyond<br>
the faceâ€”knows and examines<br>
the passing season
