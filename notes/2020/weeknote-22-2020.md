* Landscaping in the backyard. The tomatoes have not done well since moving them outside. I transferred them to 5 gallon buckets, hopefully a larger container and consistent moisture will help. 
* The peonies bloomed this week, a day or two after Memorial Day. The azaleas have had their best spring in several years but are beginning to fade. The iris canâ€™t support the weight of the to blooms and bend in toward the ground crisscrossing each other. 
* My dad tested _negative_ for COVID-19 after learning of two potential exposures. 
* No Memorial Day services. We drove to Jester Park to see the bison instead. Multiple rain showers and tornado sirens. By evening  the skies were mostly clear but the clouds in the west still lingered, creating a shifting horizon and an extended twilight.
