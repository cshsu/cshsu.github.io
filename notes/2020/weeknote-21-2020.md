* Saturday afternoon we had another birthday parade on our block. 
* This is a very interesting solution from Ken Hawkins: [Fractal and Eleventy: Getting static sites closer to the design system](https://work.allaboutken.com/posts/20191112-extendeing-fractal-components-eleventy-static-sites.html). 
* Received a nice piece in the mail: _Congresswoman Cindy Axne’s Coronavirus Relief Guide for Iowa Employers_. 
* We came home from the hardware store to find two police cars, a fire truck, a line of cars, and a man with a television camera from channel 5 just up the block. I approached the cameraman and asked what was going on. “It’s a birthday parade,” he said. _This_ I had not considered. A fire or heart attack, yes. A parade on a random Monday night, no. In an effort to social distance, my neighbor’s friends gathered themselves (and the local public safety—including the fire station’s Dalmatian, Ember) for a two block parade past her house. We went back outside later and waved as they drove past. They threw candy. I got a KitKat. 
* Monday: 4 am. Tuesday-Thursday: 5: am.
