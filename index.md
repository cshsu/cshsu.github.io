<p class="text--larger"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ello! My name is Josh Crain. I have worked as a web designer, product designer, and UI developer. Design allows me to make an impact through user advocacy, research, web standards, and code. Most recently, my interests have focused on how to build a better design system and the exciting new possibilities of static site generation.</p>
<p class="text--larger">I want to spend <em>a lot more time</em> drawing, painting, and in my sketchbook. There are also <a href="/notes/other-interesting-things/">other interesting things</a>.</p>

## Recent Art
A selection of digital, gouache, and watercolor paintings. Some are new some are old. Some are slightly embarassing.
