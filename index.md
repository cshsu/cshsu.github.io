<p style="text-align: justify">I'm a device and test characterization engineer at onsemi based in Gresham, OR. I previously worked at Micron as a semiconductor design engineer in charge of DRAM test structure design for the state-of-the-art technology nodes. I obtained an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan in 2011 and a PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering under Professor Azad Naeemi at the Georgia Institute of Technology, GA, USA in 2021. With the technical interest in fundamental physical mechanisms and design simulations of emerging nanoelectronic devices, my PhD research focuses on the potential applications of ferroelectric materials in electronic devices in the nanoscale regime. I also regularly serve as a reviewer for peer-reviewed journals like IEEE Electron Device Letters. Through invaluable PhD training, I have developed strong background knowledge in ferroelectric materials, research implementation skills from physical mechanisms to circuit-level analyses, and practical experience in academic/technical writing. I'm particularly interested in semiconductor-related engineer positions in an industrial company as my professional career path.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">On this website, my cirriculum vitae and research can be found in the <a href="/resume/"><i>Cirriculum Vitae</i></a> tab and the <a href="/research/"><i>Research</i></a> tab, respectively. I would also like to try keeping technical notes in the <a href="/notes/preface/"><i>Notes</i></a> tab. If you're tired of work, some life-related stuff can be found in the other tabs.</p>
