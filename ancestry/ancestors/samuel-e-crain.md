Sam was the youngest of three brothers. He was born on November 19, 1952, in Eldora, Iowa to Eldon and Luella (Coleman) Crain. Sam grew up near Zearing, Iowa on the family farm. He was active in 4H and attended Zearing Christian Church and NESCO schools. He played the clarinet in the band, sang, and taught himself to play the guitar. After high school, he attended Marshalltown Community College where he made lifelong friendships. On June 26, 1976, Sam married Jana Myers in Maxwell, Iowa. They had two sons. He attended Hillside Christian Church and New Hope Christian Church in Marshalltown, Iowa.

It was important for Sam to provide for his family. He worked at Smith Music, Surplus Supply, Landon Landon, and Fisher Controls. At times he worked two jobs. One winter, during a difficult layoff, he made the boy’s Christmas gifts. Sam also worked in the Marshall County Engineer’s office as a technician. He enjoyed the work and the friendship of his coworkers. In 1998, while helping a friend, Sam fell from a ladder and sustained a traumatic brain injury. In 1999 Sam found it necessary to retire from the county after 15 years.

Life became more difficult for Sam after his accident but he continued to share his time. Sam assisted with childcare for Parents Supporting Parents and toddler Sunday School. He was proud to help in the Butterfly Wing at Reiman Gardens in Ames, Iowa as a docent.

Sam was known for his dry and offbeat humor, his music, his ability to talk and connect with strangers, his willingness to help others, and his faith in God. He will always be remembered as a great father.

Sam is survived by his son Joshua Crain and daughter-in-law Nicole of Windsor Heights, Iowa. His son Zachary Crain and daughter-in-law Caroline of Zearing, Iowa. His brother Rex Crain of Toledo, Iowa; and sister-in-law Nancy Crain of Nevada, Iowa.

Sam was preceded in death by his parents, an infant brother, brother Darrel Crain, and sister-in-law Barbretta Crain.
