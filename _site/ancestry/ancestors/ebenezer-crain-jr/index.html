                <p><i>Ebenezer Crain Jr.</i> was born in Surry, New Hampshire in 1819. He married Calista Coburn, of Chesterfield, New Hampshire in 1841. She was born in March, 1824. The name Coburn suggests a Scottish lineage.</p>
    <p> They lived in Surry, New Hampshire as late as the 1850 U.S census. At that time, at the age of 32, he did not own any land although he worked in agriculture. At the time of the 1870 U.S. Census (June, 18) Ebenezer and Calista lived in Belle Plaine, Wisconsin with 7 children: Albert, Louisa, Alva, Arthur, Agnes, Alice and Emma. The family eventually settled in Zearing, Iowa and lived near the Sunset post office. At the time of the 1900 U.S. Census  (June 15), Ebenezer and Calista lived in the Lincoln Township in Story County, Iowa and had been married 59 years.  </p>
    <p>Calista died October 16, 1900 and Ebenezer died February 1, 1905. They are buried in the Illinois Grove Cemetery, located in Marshall County.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The Crain Family is one of our community’s leading families in 1956. We are indebted to Albert W. Crain for the sketch of the pioneer family.</p>
      <p>Ebenezer Crain was born July, 1819. His wife, Calista, was born March, 1823. We are not certain if we have Calista’s maiden name spelled correctly. The name we have is Cobern. It is possible the name was Cobert or Colbert.</p>
      <p>We know that Ebenezer and Calista lived in New Hampshire after their marriage. They moved to our community in 1876 from Wisconsin. Their first home in our community was located near the Sunset post office. Later they lived in the Grant Center community of Hardin County.</p>
      <p>We know that three of their children came to our community in 1876. They were Arthur L., Alice and Albert. A daughter, Julia, came with her husband, John Adams. </p>
      <p>Ebenezer died on February 1, 1905. Calista died on October 16, 1900. They are buried in the Illinois Grove Cemetery.</p>
